## MATSim User Meeting

This year the annual MATSim user meeting will be in Warsaw, Poland.
The meeting occurs on April 6th just a day before the [ANT conference](http://cs-conferences.acadiau.ca/ant-20/),
which begins on Tuesday, April 7th.
The meeting will last for the whole day, alternating presentations and time for exchange.
Holding a presentation is by no means a condition for attending the meeting,
so feel free to register to hear about other's work and exchange.

## Call for Abstracts

We are now accepting submissions for the User Meeting from both Science and Industry.

Submissions for the User Meeting should take the form of an abstract (< 1000 words), and are to be submitted before February 29, 2020, through
[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/cfp/matsim2020).

MATSim-related submissions to the main conference will as well be considered for inclusion in the User Meeting program.

Notifications of acceptance will follow shortly after that date.

Please feel free to forward this information to any of your contacts, by sharing the link to the EasyChair call for papers:

[https://easychair.org/cfp/matsim2020](https://easychair.org/cfp/matsim2020)

All questions about submissions should be emailed to [matsim2020@ethz.ch](mailto:matsim2020@ethz.ch)

## Registration

In order to cover for the costs of room rental, coffee breaks and lunch,

To register, please enter your contact information below **before February 20, 2020**.
We will come back to you in due time with bank transfer information.
