## MATSim User Meeting

This year the annual MATSim user meeting will be in Warsaw, Poland.
The meeting occurs on April 6th just a day before the [ANT conference](http://cs-conferences.acadiau.ca/ant-20/),
which begins on Tuesday, April 7th.
The meeting will last for the whole day, alternating presentations and time for exchange.
Holding a presentation is by no means a condition for attending the meeting,
so feel free to register to hear about other's work and exchange.

The user meeting will be followed by a _business meeting_,
where strategic decisions relevant to the future of MATSim are discussed.
To keep the group size manageable, we recommend that each institution decides on
(at most) one person to attend that meeting.

This year, the discussions will mostly revolve around the foundation of a
_MATSim Association_. The aim of that association is to become the entity steering
further development of the MATSim platform, a role which was until now taken by academic chairs.
The association should provide various benefits to the community as whole, in particular:

- Give a formal way for each and every user to participate in decisions, by becoming a member
- Ensure long-term stability of the development, by making it less dependent on the continuity of the academic chairs
- Give the possibility for interested industrial users to pay for a commercial license.
    The revenue from those licenses will allow to finance further
    development and maintenance of the GPL-licensed version of MATSim,
    while keeping membership fees to a reasonable level.

The day will close with the formal _foundation meeting_,
after which the association will legally start its existence.

Three [documents](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/vXPsHvfwwfooTE0)
where prepared and will be discussed:
- the articles of the association, listing its purpose and rules
- the _contribution agreement_, through which all past developers will be able to give the right
    to the association to use their contribution to fulfill its mission,
    by sharing ownership
- the _contributor terms_, which future contributors will have to accept when doing a pull request.
