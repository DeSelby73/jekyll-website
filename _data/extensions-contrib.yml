- name: drt
  maintainer: Michal Maciejewski, Joschka Bischoff
  availability: Contrib
  status: Unknown
  user-docs: It uses the DVRP contrib to implement DRT as a on-demand transport service, i.e. DRT requests are submitted in an online manner. The main difference to the taxi contrib is that rides can be shared (e.g. shared taxis or minibuses) and occupied vehicles can be diverted from the current destination to pick up new passengers on the way (taxi allowed diversion for empty vehicles only).

- name: matrixbasedptrouter
  maintainer: currently unmaintained
  availability: Contrib
  status: Unknown
  user-docs: In some places, this module does not function like someone trained in transport engineering may think. 
      For example, (1) It does not work without pt stops, although intuitively routing from zone to zone should be possible even without pt stops.(2) It uses the nearest pt stops rather than the multi-node Dijkstra that is used in matsim schedule-based transit, which in general looks into more than one pt stop.  This would useful since walking to a somewhat farther away stop might lead to  a much better connection. (3) It can currently only read distances and travel times between pt stops, although in general it should be possible to include fare or number of line switches. (4) The result does not depend on the time-of-day.

  status: Unknown
  api-docs: See <a href="http://matsim.org/javadoc">Javadoc overview page</a>
  description: Computation of road traffic noise levels and noise damages
  user-docs: This package provides some tools to compute... <ul>
      <li>noise (emission) levels on network links (based on traffic volume, share of heavy goods vehicles, speed level)</li>
      <li>noise (immission) levels at receiver points (based on the surrounding links' emissions and distances)</li>
      <li>population units (= population densities) at receiver points (mapping agents to the nearest receiver point)</li>
      <li>noise damages (= noise exposure costs) at receiver points (based on population units and noise levels)</li></ul>
      The computation of noise levels is based on the German RLS 90 approach (Richtlinien fuer den Laermschutz and Strassen, Forschungsgesellschaft fuer Strassen- und Verkehrswesen), but applies some simplifications and minor modifications. Thus, noise levels should be considered as estimates rather than exact values. The conversion of noise exposures into monetary costs follows a slightly modified version of the German EWS approach (Empfehlungen fuer Wirtschaftlichkeitsuntersuchungen an Strassen, Forschungsgesellschaft fuer Strassen- und Verkehrswesen). A more detailed description of the computation methodology and the model limitations is provided in the related publications.
      See matsim.org/javadoc under "noise" for more information.
