The 2018 MATSim User Meeting will be held on **23 June, 2018, in Atlanta, Georgia USA**. That is the Saturday before the Transportation Research Board’s bi-annual **Innovations in Travel Modeling conference**, which is June 24-27, 2018.

- Abstracts and/or short papers are due on <b><font style="color:red;">November 30, 2017</font></b>. The papers are expected to be very short (< 2500 equivalent words), but the deadline is fast approaching. ITM has an alternative “lightning talk” track which is quite interesting and only requires an abstract submission. See below for details.

- Abstracts and papers can be submitted to the ITM conference, to the MATSim Meeting, or both. We will coordinate with the main conference so that papers are not presented twice. The submission channel for the user meeting will be communicated at a later date.

- The ITM announcement is below. Details on registration for the MATSim User Meeting will be forthcoming.
