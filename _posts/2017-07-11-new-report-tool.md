Dear all, thank you for your contributions! The report for April-June is now online.  I got only very few contributions. I assume many of you are in "TRB writing mode" (Kay Axhausen's copyright). But if you missed the call for contributions, please have a look and let me know in case something needs to be updated. 

Happy writing!
