title: "Implementation of MATSim to simulate travel for entire US using smartphone GPS data"
summary: "This study used MATSim to simulate road travel for the entire continental United States. The travel demand (i.e. initial plans) was estimated using smartphone GPS data on a single day for the entire US. Road network was generated using data from the OpenStreetMap's repository. Study results were validated against (1) US FHWA's VMT estimates, (2) roadway count data for the entire state of Florida, and (3) RMSE's for regional travel demand models. Model performed very well at characterizing relative distributions of travel metrics. Further improvements to the model implementation that can lead to better characterization of absolute values of travel metrics are discussed."
