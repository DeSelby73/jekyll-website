The video (make sure to watch it in HD on Vimeo) shows a sub-sample of 500 K agents from the MATSim Germany scenario for private car travel. The full scenario counts 4 M agents generated from a random realization of the national German travel survey (Mobilit√§t in Deutschland 2008), calibrated against 2500 count stations and OD-flows of navigation devices. The network of major roads (360 K links) as well as more than 4 M activity locations are extracted from openstreemap.org. The scenario consists of full-day travel plans with activities of type home, work, edu, shop, leisure and misc.
