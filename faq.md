### MATSim Q&A and FAQ

We have moved to using Github Issues for tracking user questions and answers. Anyone can view existing issues without a login. To pose your own questions, you'll first need to sign up for a free Github account.

- **MATSim Q&A on Github here: --> <https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-code-examples/issues>**

**NOTE:** the former Q&A on the Atlassian Confluence Wiki is still online for reference at:

- <https://matsim.atlassian.net/wiki/questions>
- Note that you must be signed up for Confluence in order to view the old Q&A site -- which is why we've moved to using Github Issues.
- You can sign up at <https://id.atlassian.com/signup>.
