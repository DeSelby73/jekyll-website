## Download/Install MATSim

Some options to get hold of MATSim are described here. These are in the recommended order for most users.
 
#### (1) MATSim example project on GitHub

The recommended approach to getting started with MATSim is to start with the example project on GitHub. This approach targets programmers who are comfortable with Java and an IDE (e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ). This will automatically download MATSim, allow you to browse the source code, and keep you up-to-date with releases or snapshots. 

You will _not_ be able to modify the existing MATSim source code -- which, in most cases, should not be necessary. It is preferred that you contact the developers in such situations and we will try to help or implement missing extension points.

#### (2) Standalone

The "Standalone" version is targeted to users who are fluent at the command line interface and want to use MATSim by editing the input files, including config.xml directly. A basic GUI is provided.

##### Latest Release

Version 0.9.0 "Spring 2017", released August 2017

- Download ZIP  ca. 20 MB
- Extensions / Contribs
- Older versions
- Even older versions (on sourceforge)

#####   Development Version

These versions are typically less stable and don't come with up-to-date documenation, but may contain new features.

- Download a Nightly Build.

#### (3) Maven

The "Maven" version is targeted to programmers who know about Maven, and want to include MATSim into an already existing Maven project.  Similar to the "MATSim example project" above, the Maven approach will maven-download MATSim, allow you to browse the source code, and keep you up-to-date with releases or snapshots (depending on your pom.xml). 

It will _not_ allow you to modify the existing MATSim code -- which, in most cases, also should not be necessary: it is preferred that you contact the developers in such situations and we will try to help or implement missing extension points.
