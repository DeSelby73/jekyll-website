Open Scenario Data
==================

The following is a list of known scenario data sets that are open and free to use with MATSim. Not all data sets contain all required files to run a MATSim model. Some may only provide a network for example.

Please, give credit when using these scenarios.

VSP, TU Berlin
--------------

Berlin:
<https://github.com/matsim-vsp/matsim-berlin>

Ruhr area: https://github.com/matsim-vsp/matsim-ruhrgebiet

Sweden: https://github.com/matsim-vsp/matsim-sweden

Some other open source example data sets, including some regional real world data sets. The directories are hierarchically organized and should be self-explanatory. We try to provide readme files, but this does not always work:
<https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/matsim/scenarios/>

South Africa
------------

Prof. Johan Joubert from the University of Pretoria has open sourced some of the scenarios he built, each consisting of a network and a population:

MATSim Test Examples
--------------------
Some smaller scenarios are directly contained in the MATSim source repository, often used for feature demonstration or tests: <https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim/tree/master/examples>

<!-- matsimExamples -->
<!-- -------------- -->
<!-- There is also a separate "matsimExamples" repository on our GitHub site, but that seems to be rarely used. -->

Other links to open data
------------------------
(just a list of links we've come across)

A registry of public transit data: http://transit.land .

German rail:

- See <http://data.deutschebahn.com/blog/2016/02/25/fahrplan> for a German introduction and <http://data.deutschebahn.com/apis/fahrplan> for the API description; you'll need an API key that can be had by sending a simple E-Mail to DB's Open Data Team.
- Einen Monat spaeter hat jemand aus den API-Daten einen GTFS-Fahrplan extrahiert: <https://github.com/fredlockheed/db-fv-gtfs>


Visualizations
--------------

(this is not necessarily "data", but links to data and links to visualizations often come together and/or cannot be cleanly separated)
