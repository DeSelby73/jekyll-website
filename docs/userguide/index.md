# The MATSim user guide

<br/>


There is an [extract of the first couple of chapters, which contains the most relevant topics for new users](http://ci.matsim.org:8080/job/MATSim-Book/ws/partOne-latest.pdf) [PDF].

<small><mark>If the above link does not seem to work, try to right-click the link and select "Save Link As…" or "Download Linked File As…" or similar, depending on your browser.</mark></small>

The user guide is typically updated along with the MATSim class that we teach every year at TU Berlin between April and June.
