### User's Guide

The ["MATSim Book"](/the-book) is now the authoritative reference. The book is diveded into four parts, covering a broad range of topics.

There is an extract of the first couple of chapters, which contains the most relevant topics for new users:

[Latest version of the book extract](http://ci.matsim.org:8080/job/MATSim-Book/ws/partOne-latest.pdf) [PDF]

- If the above link seems not to work, try to right-click the link and select "Save Link As…" or "Download Linked File As…" or similar, depending on your browser.
- It is planned that this book extract will be updated once a year to stay consistent with the code.

- Provides specification of key-aspects of MATSim (e.g. file formats, simulation events, ...)
- Lists some guidelines for developers (e.g. coding conventions) to keep MATSim maintainable.
- Gives information about certain packages, how to (programmatically) use them and what features they offer.
offers additional pieces of information that may/should be of interest to developers (e.g. how to use Eclipse for development, or some Java-tips)
