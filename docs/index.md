### Information for users

The ["MATSim Book"](/the-book) is now the authoritative reference. 

There is an [extract of the first couple of chapters, which contains the most relevant topics for new users](/docs/userguide).  This is sometimes also referred to as the [``MATSim user guide''](/docs/userguide).

Some [Terminology](/docs/userguide/terminology) (i.e. correspondences between MATSim terminology and more standard transport modelling terminology, and reasons why ours is different) can be found [here](/docs/userguide/terminology).

### Information for developers

These documents ...

- ... provide specification of key-aspects of MATSim (e.g. file formats, simulation events, ...)
- ... list some guidelines for developers (e.g. coding conventions) to keep MATSim maintainable.
- ... give information about certain packages, how to (programmatically) use them and what features they offer.
offers additional pieces of information that may/should be of interest to developers (e.g. how to use Eclipse for development, or some Java-tips)
