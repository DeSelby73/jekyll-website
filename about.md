### Agent-Based Transport Simulations

MATSim provides a framework to implement large-scale agent-based transport simulations. The framework consists of severel modules which can be combined or used stand-alone. Modules can be replaced by custom implementations to test single aspects of your own work.

Currently, MATSim offers a framework for demand-modeling, agent-based mobility-simulation (traffic flow simulation), re-planning, a controler to iteratively run simulations as well as methods to analyze the output generated by the modules.


#### Key Features of MATSim

##### Fast Dynamic and Agent-Based Traffic Simulation
- Simulate whole days within minutes

##### Private and Public Traffic
- Both private cars and transit traffic can be simulated

##### Supports Large Scenarios
- MATSim can simulate millions of agents or huge, detailed networks

##### Versatile Analyses and Simulation Output
- E.g. compare simulated data to real-world counting stations

##### Modular Approach
- Easily extended with your own algorithms

##### Open Source
- You get the Java Source Code, which runs on all major operating systems

##### Active Development
- The international MATSim community constantly adds new features and improves current ones

##### Start using MATSim
- To learn more, look at the documentation or at the scenarios to see how others use MATSim.
